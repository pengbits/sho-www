# SHO WWW
This is a stripped-down version of the sho.com front-end repository. It serves primarily as a context for demonstrating the styleguide integration, but without any environmental dependencies (ie for personal use).

# Getting started
To see the styleguide in action, run this task, then browse http://localhost:4000:

```
npm run dev:styleguide # kicks off webpack watcher task
```

To view a locally served (static) instance of the sho.com homepage, run this task, then browse http://localhost:3000:

```
npm run serve:sho # runs simple server with python, assumes flattened index.html in directory
```

# Notes
use version 12 of node
