# SHO WWW
This is a stripped-down version of the sho.com front-end repository. It serves primarily as a context for demonstrating the styleguide integration, but without any environmental dependencies (ie for personal use).

# Getting started
to see the styleguide run locally, run this task, then browse https://localhost:4000:

```
npm run dev:styleguide
```

# Notes
use version 12 of node
