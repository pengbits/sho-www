README
these css files contain the inline styles that were extracted from optimizely, 
for a sample personalization campaign: On Becoming a God x DTC Landing Page
the vairation code contained some custom css, mostly for adjusting the hero image into place,
I then extended these changes to incorporate some styles need to undo the breaking changes from the animated hero component,
Hopefully, these css changes are templated and applicable to others (not one-off changes that are tied to hero art content!)
adding the css in before and after state to git, for historic purposes only. this is not included in the css layer

for more context, see this experiment
