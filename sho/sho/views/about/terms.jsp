      <h2 class="legal__headline">Terms of Use</h2>

      <p class="legal__body">Effective Date January 12, 2023</p>
      <p class="legal__body">Welcome to the network of interactive services provided by Showtime Networks Inc. or its affiliates (collectively, &quot;Provider,&quot; &quot;Showtime Networks,&quot; &quot;us,&quot; or &quot;we&quot;). These Terms of Use, including the  <a class="legal__body__link" href="#disputes-arbitration">&quot;Dispute Resolution; Arbitration Agreement&quot; provisions </a> in Section 1 below (&quot;Terms&quot;), govern your use of the websites, mobile and connected TV applications, features, products and services that include an authorized link to these Terms (collectively, the &quot;Services&quot;).</p>

      <p class="legal__body">Please review these Terms carefully before using the Services because they affect your rights.  By using any of the Services, you accept these Terms and agree to be legally bound by them.</p>

      <p class="legal__body">Please consult our <a class="legal__body__link" href="https://www.viacomcbsprivacy.com/policy">Privacy Policy</a> for information regarding our privacy practices.</p>

      <p class="legal__body">Certain provisions of these Terms apply only to specified Services.  For example, special provisions applicable to the Showtime standalone streaming service (the &quot;Streaming Service&quot;) are contained in Section 8, and special provisions applicable to Showtime Anytime are contained in Section 9.  If you are a user of either of those Services, those sections apply to you, in addition to other provisions of these Terms.  References to Services throughout these Terms include the Streaming Service and Showtime Anytime.</p>

      <p class="legal__body" id="disputes-arbitration">These Terms are effective as of the Effective Date above. If you have not reviewed the Terms of Use applicable to a Service since the Effective Date, please review these updated Terms carefully before using any Service.</p>

      <p class="legal__body">We may change these Terms in the future, so we encourage you to review periodically the Terms of Use applicable to each Service you use. The most current version of the applicable Terms of Use (along with its effective date) will be linked from each of the Services. Changes to these Terms will be effective immediately or, if required by law, 30 days after notice to you, which may be given by posting the updated Terms on our Services or by electronic or conventional mail. If you do not agree with any changes to these Terms, your sole remedy is not to use the Services.
      If you continue to use the Services after we change these Terms, you accept all changes.</p>

      <h4 class="legal__sub-headline">1. Dispute Resolution; Arbitration Agreement</h4>

      <p class="legal__body">IF YOU OR WE HAVE ANY DISPUTE WITH OR CLAIM AGAINST THE OTHER (A &quot;CLAIM&quot;) ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING IN ANY WAY TO THE SERVICES OR THESE TERMS, AND THE CLAIM IS NOT RESOLVED BY CALLING OUR CUSTOMER CARE DEPARTMENT AT (877)4-SHOWTIME ((877)474-6984) OR BY FOLLOWING THE INFORMAL DISPUTE RESOLUTION PROCEDURE SET FORTH BELOW, YOU AND WE EACH AGREE TO RESOLVE SUCH DISPUTES THROUGH AN INDIVIDUAL BINDING ARBITRATION OR AN INDIVIDUAL ACTION IN SMALL CLAIMS COURT. Class arbitrations and class actions are not permitted, and a Claim may not be consolidated with any other person's claim. You and we agree that the U.S. Federal Arbitration Act governs the interpretation and enforcement of this provision, and that you and we are each waiving the right to a trial by jury or to participate in a class action. You and we agree that any arbitrations between you and us will be subject to this Section 1 and not to any prior arbitration agreement you had with us. This Section 1 shall survive termination of these Terms or any subscription that you may have to any of the Services.</p>

      <p class="legal__body">1.1 Mandatory Pre-Arbitration Notice and Informal Dispute Resolution Procedure. Before a party commences an arbitration or files a small claims court action with respect to a Claim, the party must first send to the other a written notice of dispute (&quot;Notice&quot;). A Notice from you to us must (1) be sent by certified mail; (2) be addressed to: Showtime Networks Inc., 1633 Broadway, New York, NY 10019, Attn: Legal Department; (3) contain your name, address, and email address; (4) describe the nature and basis of your Claim; (5) if you are submitting the Notice, include any relevant facts regarding your use of the Services, including without limitation whether you have created an account; (6) specify the nature and basis of the specific relief sought, including the damages sought, if any, and a detailed calculation of them; and (7) include a personally signed statement from you (and not your counsel) verifying the accuracy of the contents of the Notice. The Notice must be individualized, meaning it can concern only your dispute and no other person's dispute.</p>

      <p class="legal__body">After receipt of a completed Notice, the parties shall engage in a good faith effort to resolve the dispute for a period of 60 days (which can be extended by agreement). You and we agree that, after receipt of the completed Notice, the recipient may request an individualized telephone or video settlement conference (which can be held after the 60-day period) and both parties will personally attend (with counsel, if represented). You and we agree that the parties (and counsel, if represented) shall work cooperatively to schedule the conference at the earliest mutually-convenient time and to seek to reach a resolution. If we and you do not reach an agreement to resolve the issues identified in the Notice within 60 days after the completed Notice is received (or a longer time if agreed to by the parties), you or we may commence an arbitration proceeding or a small claims court proceeding (if permitted by small claims court rules).</p>

      <p class="legal__body">Compliance with this Mandatory Pre-Arbitration Notice and Informal Dispute Resolution Procedures section is a condition precedent to initiating arbitration. Any applicable limitations period (including statute of limitations) and any filing fee deadlines shall be tolled while the parties engage in the informal dispute resolution procedures set forth in this Subsection 1.1. All of the Mandatory Pre-Arbitration Notice and Informal Dispute Resolution Procedures are essential so that you and we have a meaningful opportunity to resolve disputes informally. If any aspect of these requirements has not been met, a court of competent jurisdiction may enjoin the filing or prosecution of an arbitration. In addition, unless prohibited by law, the arbitration administrator may not accept, administer, assess, or demand fees in connection with an arbitration that has been initiated without completion of the Mandatory Pre-Arbitration Notice and Informal Dispute Resolution Procedure. If the arbitration is already pending, it shall be administratively closed. Nothing in this paragraph limits the right of a party to seek damages for non-compliance with this Procedure in arbitration.</p>

      <p class="legal__body">1.2 Arbitration Procedure. Any such arbitration shall be governed by applicable rules of National Arbitration & Mediation (&quot;NAM&quot;) (including the <a class="legal__body__link" href="https://www.namadr.com/content/uploads/2022/04/Comprehensive-Rules-as-of-4.18.2022.pdf">Comprehensive Dispute Resolution Rules and Procedures</a> and/or the <a class="legal__body__link" href="https://www.namadr.com/content/uploads/2021/12/SupplementalRules12.22.21.pdf">Supplemental Rules for Mass Arbitration Filings</a>, as applicable) (&quot;NAM Rules&quot;), as modified by this Arbitration Agreement, and will be administered by NAM. (If NAM is unavailable or unwilling to do so, another arbitration provider shall be selected by the parties that will do so, or if the parties are unable to agree on an alternative administrator, by the court pursuant to 9 U.S.C. ยง5.) The NAM Rules are available online at www.NAMADR.com, by calling NAM at 1-800-358-2550, or by requesting them in writing at the Notice Address. You may obtain a form to initiate arbitration at: <a class="legal__body__link" style="word-break:break-all;" href="https://www.namadr.com/content/uploads/2020/09/Comprehensive-Demand-for-Arb-revised-9.18.19.pdf">https://www.namadr.com/content/uploads/2020/09/Comprehensive-Demand-for-Arb-revised-9.18.19.pdf</a> or by contacting NAM.</p>

      <p class="legal__body">You and we agree that the party initiating arbitration must submit a certification that they have complied with and completed the Mandatory Pre-Arbitration Notice and Informal Dispute Resolution Procedures requirements referenced in Subsection 1.1 and that they are a party to the Arbitration Agreement enclosed with or attached to the demand for arbitration. The demand for arbitration and certification must be personally signed by the party initiating arbitration (and their counsel, if represented). </p>

      <p class="legal__body">All issues, including the scope and enforceability of this Arbitration Agreement, are for the arbitrator to decide. The arbitrator may consider but shall not be bound by rulings in other arbitrations involving different customers. At the conclusion of the arbitration proceeding, the arbitrator shall issue a reasoned written decision sufficient to explain the essential findings and conclusions on which the award is based. The arbitrator's decision is binding only between you and us and will not have any preclusive effect in another arbitration or proceeding that involves a different party. An arbitrator's award that has been fully satisfied shall not be entered in any court.</p>

      <p class="legal__body">As in court, you and we agree that any counsel representing a party in arbitration certifies when initiating and proceeding in arbitration that they are complying with the requirements of Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 11(b), including certification that the claim or relief sought is neither frivolous nor brought for an improper purpose. The arbitrator is authorized to impose any sanctions under the NAM Rules, Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 11, or applicable federal or state law, against all appropriate represented parties and counsel.</p>

      <p class="legal__body">Except as expressly provided in this Arbitration Agreement, the arbitrator may grant any remedy, relief, or outcome that the parties could have received in court, including awards of attorneys' fees and costs, in accordance with applicable law. Unless otherwise provided by applicable law, the parties shall bear their own attorneys' fees and costs in arbitration unless the arbitrator awards sanctions or finds that either the substance of the claim, the defense, or the relief sought is frivolous or brought for an improper purpose (as measured by the standards set forth in Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 11(b).</p>

      <p class="legal__body">The payment of arbitration fees (the fees imposed by the arbitration administrator including filing, arbitrator, and hearing fees) will be governed by the applicable NAM Rules, unless you qualify for a fee waiver under applicable law.</p>

      <p class="legal__body">In circumstances in which the NAM Rules provide for an in-person hearing, such hearing will take place in the U.S. county (or parish) of your residence, or otherwise in New York, New York. If the Mass Filing process described in Subsection 1.7 is triggered, then the location of any hearing will be determined by the arbitrator.</p>

      <p class="legal__body">1.3 Discovery During Arbitration. The parties shall each be limited to a maximum of one (1) fact witness deposition per side, unless the arbitrator determines that more depositions are warranted based on the totality of circumstances, including the amount in controversy, the complexity of the factual issues, the number of parties and the diversity of their interests, and whether any or all of the claims appear, on the basis of the pleadings, to have sufficient merit to justify the time and expense associated with the requested discovery. Document requests shall be limited to documents that are directly relevant to the matter(s) in dispute or to its outcome; shall be reasonably restricted in terms of time frame, subject matter and persons or entities to which the requests pertain; shall not include broad phraseology such as &quot;all documents directly or indirectly related to&quot;; and shall not be encumbered with extensive &quot;definitions&quot; or &quot;instructions.&quot; The Arbitrator may edit or limit the number of document requests based on the totality of circumstances, including the factors listed above.</p>

      <p class="legal__body">Electronic discovery, if any, shall be limited as follows. Absent a showing of compelling need: (i) electronic documents shall only be produced from sources used in the ordinary course of business, and not from backup servers, tapes or other media; (ii) the production of electronic documents shall normally be made on the basis of generally available technology in a searchable format that is usable by the requesting party and convenient and economical for the producing party; (iii) the parties need not produce metadata, with the exception of header fields for email correspondence; (iv) the description of custodians from whom electronic documents may be collected should be narrowly tailored to include only those individuals whose electronic documents may reasonably be expected to contain evidence that is material to the dispute; and (v) where the costs and burdens of e-discovery are disproportionate to the nature of the dispute or to the amount in controversy, or to the relevance of the materials requested, the arbitrator may either deny such requests or order disclosure on the condition that the requesting party advance the reasonable cost of production to the other side, subject to the allocation of costs in the final award. </p>

      <p class="legal__body">1.4 Confidentiality. Upon either party's request, the arbitrator will issue an order requiring that confidential information of either party disclosed during the arbitration (whether in documents or orally) may not be used or disclosed except in connection with the arbitration or a proceeding to enforce the arbitration award and that any permitted court filing of confidential information must be done under seal to the furthest extent permitted by law.</p>

      <p class="legal__body">1.5 Offer of Settlement. In any arbitration between you and us, the defending party may, but is not obligated to, make a written settlement offer at any time before the evidentiary hearing or, if a dispositive motion is permitted, prior to the dispositive motion being granted. The amount or terms of any settlement offer may not be disclosed to the arbitrator until after the arbitrator issues an award on the claim. If the award is issued in the other party's favor and is less than the defending party's settlement offer or if the award is in the defending party's favor, the other party must pay the defending party's costs incurred after the offer was made, including any attorney's fees. If any applicable statute or case law prohibits the shifting of costs incurred in the arbitration, then the offer in this provision shall serve to cease the accumulation of any costs to which the party bringing the claim may be entitled for the cause of action under which it is suing.</p>

      <p class="legal__body">1.6 Opt Out of Future Changes. Notwithstanding any provision to the contrary, if we make any future change to this Arbitration Agreement (other than a change to the Notice Address), you may reject any such change by sending us an opt out notice via certified mail addressed to Showtime Networks Inc., 1633 Broadway, New York, NY 10019, Attn: Legal Department which includes: (i) your full legal name, (ii) your complete mailing address, (iii) your phone number, (iv) if applicable, the username or email address associated with any potential account; and (v) the approximate date of your initial use of the Services. Such an opt-out notice must be sent by you personally, and not by your agent, attorney, or anyone else purporting to act on your behalf. It must include a statement, personally signed by you, that you wish to reject the change to the Arbitration Agreement. This is not an opt out of arbitration altogether.</p>

      <p class="legal__body">1.7 Mass Filing. If, at any time, 25 or more claimants (including you) submit Notices or seek to file demands for arbitration raising similar claims against the other party or related parties by the same or coordinated counsel or entities, consistent with the definition and criteria of Mass Filings (&quot;Mass Filing&quot;) set forth in NAM's Mass Filing Supplemental Dispute Resolution Rules and Procedures (&quot;NAM's Mass Filing Rules,&quot; available at <a class="legal__body__link" href="https://www.namadr.com/resources/rules-fees-forms/"> https://www.namadr.com/resources/rules-fees-forms/</a>), you and we agree that the additional procedures set forth below shall apply. The parties agree that throughout this process, their counsel shall meet and confer to discuss modifications to these procedures based on the particular needs of the Mass Filing. The parties acknowledge and agree that by electing to participate in a Mass Filing, the adjudication of their dispute might be delayed. Any applicable limitations period (including statute of limitations) and any filing fee deadlines shall be tolled beginning when the Mandatory Pre-Arbitration Notice and Informal Dispute Resolution Procedures are initiated, so long as the pre-arbitration Notice complies with the requirements in Subsection 1.1, until your claim is selected to proceed as part of a staged process or is settled, withdrawn, otherwise resolved, or opted out of arbitration.</p>

      <p class="legal__body">Stage One: Counsel for the claimants and counsel for Showtime Networks shall each select 25 claims per side (50 claims total) to be filed and to proceed in individual arbitrations as part of a staged process. Each of these individual arbitrations shall be assigned to a different, single arbitrator unless the parties agree otherwise in writing. Any remaining claims shall not be filed or be deemed filed in arbitration, nor shall any arbitration fees be assessed in connection with those claims unless and until they are selected to be filed in individual arbitration proceedings as part of a staged process. After this initial set of staged proceedings is completed, the parties shall promptly engage in a global mediation session of all remaining claims with a retired federal or state court judge and Showtime Networks shall pay the mediator's fee.</p>

      <p class="legal__body">Stage Two: If the remaining claims are not resolved at this time, counsel for the claimants and counsel for Showtime Networks shall each select 50 claims per side (100 claims total) to be filed and to proceed in individual arbitrations as part of a second staged process, subject to any procedural changes the parties agreed to in writing. Each of these individual arbitrations shall be assigned to a different, single arbitrator unless the parties agree otherwise in writing. Any remaining claims shall not be filed or be deemed filed in arbitration, nor shall any arbitration fees be assessed in connection with those claims unless and until they are selected to be filed in individual arbitration proceedings as part of a staged process. After this second set of staged proceedings is completed, the parties shall promptly engage in a global mediation session of all remaining claims with a retired federal or state court judge and Showtime Networks shall pay the mediator's fee.</p>

      <p class="legal__body">Stage Three: If the remaining claims are not resolved at this time, counsel for the claimants and counsel for Showtime Networks shall each select 100 claims per side (200 claims total) to be filed and to proceed in individual arbitrations as part of a third staged process, subject to any procedural changes the parties agreed to in writing. Any remaining claims shall not be filed or be deemed filed in arbitration, nor shall any arbitration fees be assessed in connection with those claims unless and until they are selected to be filed in individual arbitration proceedings as part of a staged process. Following this third set of staged proceedings, counsel for claimants may elect to have the parties participate in a global mediation session of all remaining claims with a retired federal or state court judge.</p>

      <p class="legal__body">If your claim is not resolved as part of the staged process identified above, either:</p>
      <p class="legal__body">Option One: You and Showtime Networks may separately or by agreement, opt out of arbitration and elect to have your claim heard in court consistent with these Terms. You may opt out of arbitration by sending Showtime Networks your individual, personally signed notice of your intention to opt out by certified mail addressed to Showtime Networks Inc., 1633 Broadway, New York, NY 10019, Attn: Legal Department. Such an opt-out notice must be sent by you personally, and not by your agent, attorney, or anyone else purporting to act on your behalf. It must include a statement, personally signed by you, that you wish to opt out of arbitration within 30 days after the conclusion of Stage 3 or the elective mediation associated with Stage 3. Showtime Networks may opt your claim out of arbitration by sending an individual, personally signed notice of its intention to opt out to your counsel within 14 days after the expiration of your 30 day opt out period. Counsel for the parties may agree to adjust these deadlines.</p>

      <p class="legal__body">OR</p>
      <p class="legal__body">Option Two: If neither you nor Showtime Networks elect to have your claim heard in court consistent with Option One, then you agree that your claim will be resolved as part of continuing, staged individual arbitration proceedings as set forth below. Assuming the number of remaining claims exceeds 200, then 200 claims shall be randomly selected (or selected through a process agreed to by counsel for the parties) to be filed and to proceed in individual arbitrations as part of a staged process. If the number of remaining claims is fewer than 200, then all of those claims shall be filed and proceed in individual arbitrations. Any remaining claims shall not be filed or be deemed filed in arbitration, nor shall any arbitration fees be assessed in connection with those claims unless and until they are selected to be filed in individual arbitration proceedings as part of a staged process. After each set of 200 claims are adjudicated, settled, withdrawn, or otherwise resolved, this process shall repeat consistent with these parameters. Counsel for the parties are encouraged to meet and confer, participate in mediation, and engage with each other and with NAM (including through a Procedural Arbitrator) to explore ways to streamline the adjudication of claims, increase the number of claims to proceed at any given time, promote efficiencies, conserve resources, and resolve the remaining claims.</p>

      <p class="legal__body">A court of competent jurisdiction shall have the authority to enforce these Mass Filing provisions and, if necessary, to enjoin the mass filing, prosecution, or administration of arbitrations and the assessment of arbitration fees. If these additional procedures apply to your claim, and a court of competent jurisdiction determines that they are not enforceable as to your claim, then your claim shall proceed in a court of competent jurisdiction consistent with these Terms. </p>

      <p class="legal__body">You and Showtime Networks agree that we each value the integrity and efficiency of arbitration and wish to employ the process for the fair resolution of genuine and sincere disputes between us. You and Showtime Networks acknowledge and agree to act in good faith to ensure the processes set forth herein are followed. The parties further agree that application of these Mass Filing procedures have been reasonably designed to result in an efficient and fair adjudication of such cases.</p>

      <p class="legal__body">1.8 Severability. If any portion of this Arbitration Agreement is found to be void, invalid, or otherwise unenforceable, then that portion shall be deemed to be severable and, if possible, superseded by a valid, enforceable provision, or portion thereof, that matches the intent of the original provision, or portion thereof, as closely as possible. The remainder of this Arbitration Agreement shall continue to be enforceable and valid according to the terms contained herein.</p>

      <h4 class="legal__sub-headline">2. Privacy Policy; Additional Terms</h4>

      <p class="legal__body">Some of the Services may allow you to submit or transmit to or through the Services audio, video, text, or other materials, including so-called &quot;user generated content&quot; and &quot;feedback&quot; and postings to third-party social media sites (collectively, &quot;User Submissions&quot;).  When you provide User Submissions, you grant to Provider and its affiliates and partners a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free, perpetual, irrevocable, fully sublicensable license to use, reproduce, archive, edit, translate, create derivative works of, make available, distribute, sell, display, perform, transmit, broadcast and in any other way exploit those User Submissions, and any names, voices, likenesses and other identifying information of persons that is part of those User Submissions, in any form, media, software, or technology of any kind now known or developed in the future, including, without limitation, for developing, manufacturing, and marketing products.  You hereby waive any moral rights you may have in your User Submissions. For clarity, we are not required to and will not provide any form of compensation for any use of your User Submissions.</p>

      <p class="legal__body">We respect your ownership of User Submissions.  If you owned a User Submission before providing it to us, you will continue owning it after providing it to us, subject to any rights granted in these Terms and any access granted to others.  Please note that even where a Service provides a deletion capability for User Submissions, and you delete a User Submission from the Service: </p>
        <ul class="legal__body__list">
          <li class="legal__body__list-item">The User Submission may still exist in our backup copies, which are not publicly available.</li>
          <li class="legal__body__list-item">If your User Submission was shared with third parties, those third parties may have retained copies of your User Submissions, and neither we nor our affiliates have any responsibility for any uses of your User Submission that they might make.</li>
          <li class="legal__body__list-item">We retain the license specified above.

      </ul>

      <p class="legal__body">We may impose limits on the size or number of User Submissions (e.g., limits on storage space or inbound or outbound messages) or otherwise refuse or remove a User Submission with or without cause and without notice to you.

        <h4 class="legal__sub-headline">8. Streaming Service Subscriptions and Billing</h4>
        <p class="legal__body">This Section 8 contains additional provisions that apply if you subscribe to the Streaming Service.</p>

        <p class="legal__body">8.1 Streaming Service Account Information. You can access and edit specific details regarding your subscription to the Streaming Service (including information concerning your credit card or other available payment method ("Payment Method") if you purchase your subscription from Provider) on the Streaming Service's website under "Settings."</p>

        <p class="legal__body">8.2 Device Requirements. To see if the Streaming Service is available for your device see our Help Center.</p>

        <p class="legal__body">8.3 Payment and Pricing. By placing an order for the Streaming Service through an authorized third-party distributor or Provider (each a "Distributor") and providing a Payment Method to that Distributor, you are agreeing to pay a subscription fee and any applicable taxes and service fees ("Fees") for the Streaming Service on the payment cycle designated by the Distributor. The Fees will be charged to your Payment Method at the beginning of your subscription (or, as described in Section 8.8, at the end of your Trial Period, where applicable), and thereafter on a recurring basis in accordance with your designated payment cycle, unless you cancel your subscription or your account or the Streaming Service is suspended or terminated pursuant to these Terms. Billing policies are set by Distributors. If you purchase a monthly subscription to the Streaming Service from Provider and your subscription begins after the 28th of a month, then in any subsequent month in which that day does not occur, we will charge your Payment Method on approximately the last day of such month. For example, if you started your subscription on January 31st, your next payment date will be approximately February 28th. If you do not purchase your subscription to the Streaming Service through Provider, you should confirm your Distributor's billing policies before subscribing to the Streaming Service. The Fees charged to your Payment Method may vary from time to time due to changes in your subscription plan or applicable taxes, and you authorize your Distributor to charge your Payment Method for these amounts. Each Distributor reserves the right to change the price for a subscription to the Streaming Service and will be responsible for communicating any price changes to you. If you do not wish to accept a price change, you may cancel your Streaming Service subscription as described in Section 8.5. YOU ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR ALL INTERNET ACCESS CHARGES. PLEASE CHECK WITH YOUR INTERNET PROVIDER FOR INFORMATION ON POSSIBLE INTERNET DATA USAGE CHARGES.</p>

        <p class="legal__body">8.4 No Refunds. ALL FEES ARE NON-REFUNDABLE. As described further in Section 8.5, even if you cancel the Streaming Service during a paid subscription period, you will not receive a refund for any portion of the Fees for the remainder of that subscription period. A Distributor may provide a credit, discount, or other consideration ("Credits") to certain subscribers in certain circumstances. The amount and form of such Credits, and the decision to provide them, are at the Distributor's sole discretion. The provision of Credits in one instance does not entitle you to Credits in the future for similar instances, nor does it obligate Provider or any other Distributor to provide Credits in the future, under any circumstance.</p>

        <p class="legal__body">8.5 Cancellation. If you purchased your subscription to the Streaming Service from Provider, you can cancel your subscription at any time by going to the "Settings" feature of the Streaming Service's website or by contacting us at showtime.com/help. If you purchased your subscription to the Streaming Service from another Distributor, you can cancel your subscription to the Streaming Service at any time through such Distributor's platform. With respect to all Distributors, if you cancel your subscription, the cancellation will go into effect at the end of your then-current paid subscription period. You will have continued access to the Streaming Service for the remainder of your paid subscription period, but YOU WILL NOT RECEIVE A REFUND OF ANY FEES PAID. You must cancel your subscription before it renews for the next period to avoid paying the Fees for the next period. You acknowledge and agree that cancellation of your subscription is your sole recourse if you have any dissatisfaction, issue or concern related to the Streaming Service, its Content or features, Fees, applicable taxes, or billing methods; the selection of Content available to you through the Streaming Service; these Terms, including the Provider Privacy Policy, or any changes thereto; your Distributor's billing or other policies; or any other the Streaming Service policies or practices.</p>

        <p class="legal__body">8.6 Updating Payment Method; Unpaid Amounts. You may update your Payment Method for the Streaming Service through your account with your Distributor. If your Distributor is Provider, you may update your Payment Method for the Streaming Service on the Streaming Service's website under "Settings." If you fail to pay any Fees when due, as a result of expiration of your Payment Method, invalid account details, insufficient funds, or otherwise, (1) you will remain liable for all such amounts, as well as any costs that your Distributor incurs in collecting any amounts you fail to pay in connection with the Streaming Service, including attorney and collections fees; (2) you authorize your Distributor to continue charging your Payment Method, as your Payment Method information may be updated as described above in this Section 8.6; and (3) your Distributor may suspend or terminate your subscription. Changing your Payment Method information may result in changes to your billing cycle.</p>
        
        <p class="legal__body">8.7 Promo Codes. From time to time, promotional codes may be available, including those provided as part of a third party promotion. Promotional codes may be redeemed as described in the specifics of the promotion. Promotional codes can only be used once, cannot be redeemed for cash, and may be combined with other offers, subject to certain restrictions as determined by Provider in its sole discretion. If you received a promotional code through an offer by a third party, additional conditions may apply.</p>

        <p class="legal__body">8.8. Trial Period. The Streaming Service may be offered to certain users on a free trial subscription basis for a limited time ("Trial Period"). Distributors are under no obligation to provide a Trial Period, and Trial Periods may not be available at all times. Each Distributor, as the case may be, reserves the right, in its absolute discretion, to determine your eligibility for a Trial Period. The specific terms of the Trial Period will be stated in the marketing material describing the particular Trial Period. Your subscription starts at the beginning of the Trial Period. Unless otherwise specified, (1) you may only have one Trial Period before you must begin paying for the Streaming Service, and if you exceed this limit, your Distributor may charge your Payment Method for any period after the first Trial Period, or suspend your use of the Streaming Service, in its sole discretion; (2) you must provide valid Payment Method information to use the Streaming Service during the Trial Period (although you will not be charged in connection with the Trial Period); (3) if you do not cancel the Streaming Service by the end of your Trial Period, you authorize your Distributor to automatically charge your Payment Method for the subscription period that follows immediately after the end of your Trial Period; (4) YOUR DISTRIBUTOR MAY NOT SEND YOU NOTICE THAT YOUR TRIAL PERIOD HAS ENDED OR THAT YOUR OBLIGATION TO PAY FOR YOUR SUBSCRIPTION HAS BEGUN; and (5) IF YOU WISH TO AVOID CHARGES TO YOUR PAYMENT METHOD, YOU MUST CANCEL THE SUBSCRIPTION PRIOR TO THE END OF YOUR TRIAL PERIOD.</p>
        
        
        <p class="legal__body">8.9 Gift Cards. Physical and digital gift cards may be available for subscriptions to the Streaming Service ("Gift Cards") in the United States. Internet access is required to redeem any Gift Card. Gift Cards can be redeemed at www.showtime.com/redeem. Your purchase and use of a Gift Card is governed by the Gift Card terms found <a class="legal__body__link" href="https://www.showtime.com/giftterms">here</a>.</p>

        <p class="legal__body">8.10. Updates and Testing. Provider reserves the right to update and change the Streaming Service, including its features and the selection of Content available through the Streaming Service, at any time. In addition, Provider reserves the right to test various aspects of the Streaming Service. Provider reserve the right to, and by using our Services you agree that we may, include you in or exclude you from these tests without notice.</p>

No more than three members of a household are permitted stream content at any one time.</p>

        <p class="legal__body">9.2 Access by Children. Showtime Anytime contains certain mature content that may not be appropriate for children. If the primary account holder chooses to allow any linked sub-account holder to access adult or mature content available on Showtime Anytime, the primary account holder acknowledges and agrees that such sub-account holder may be exposed to adult language as well as visual images and audio depicting nudity, sexual activity and violence. The primary account holder may establish certain "Parental Controls" through the relevant participating provider or, in certain instances, through Showtime Anytime. We will recognize the maximum movie and television ratings set by the primary account holder for each sub-account that is linked to the primary account holder.</p>

        <p class="legal__body">9.3. Termination of Your Registration. You may terminate your registration for Showtime Anytime at any time by (1) if you are a SHOWTIME subscriber through your participating provider at the time you wish to terminate your registration (a "Current SHO Subscriber"), returning to the "Settings" page of Showtime Anytime and following the instructions for termination; or (2) if you are not a Current SHO Subscriber at the time you wish to terminate your registration, by sending an email requesting termination to contact@showtime.net. If a primary account holder chooses to terminate a primary account registration, the registrations of all sub-accounts linked to the primary account holder will be terminated at the same time. We may terminate your registration at any time, with or without notice and with or without cause. </p>

        <h4 class="legal__sub-headline">10. Other Fee-Based Offerings</h4>

Except as otherwise provided in such additional terms, the provisions of this Section 10 apply to such fee-based Services.</p>

        <p class="legal__body">Unless otherwise stated, all fees and charges are non-refundable, including for unused portions of cancelled subscriptions. We do not provide price protection or refunds in the event of a price drop or promotional offering.</p>
        
        <p class="legal__body">Provider reserves the right to change the pricing of all Services at any time. In the event of a price change, Provider will post the new pricing on the relevant Service and attempt to notify you by sending an email to the address you have registered. Billing for all mobile subscription services will be governed by the Mobile Features section of these Terms (Section 11) unless the terms of the subscription say otherwise.</p>

        <p class="legal__body">We may offer trial subscriptions to paid Services for free or at special discounted prices. Unless otherwise stated, these trial subscriptions will automatically become paying subscriptions at the current subscription rate if you do not cancel before the end of the trial period.</p>

        <p class="legal__body">The Services may offer various products for sale ("Products"). You are responsible for any taxes imposed on the sale or use of Products, and applicable taxes will be added to the amount charged for Products purchased on through the Services. </p>

        <p class="legal__body">This Section 11 contains additional provisions that apply to Services designed for wireless devices (&quot;Mobile Features&quot;).</p>

        <p class="legal__body">Your wireless provider may charge for use of Mobile Features, including fees for receipt of text messages or data transmission. In order to receive Mobile Features, your wireless provider may require you to subscribe to additional services, which may require additional fees. These fees are not charged by us, and you should contact your wireless provider before you sign up for Mobile Features to determine what fees, if any, will be charged. In addition, you agree that we may arrange for Mobile Features billing through your wireless provider and that your wireless provider may invoice you for the applicable fees or deduct them from your pre-paid balance.</p>

        <p class="legal__body">You may not transfer or copy any Content from the wireless device on which you originally received Content to any other device, including, without limitation, any computer or another wireless device.</p>

        <p class="legal__body">To cancel a Mobile Feature that involves a subscription fee, you must follow the instructions included in the terms and conditions applicable to that Mobile Feature; otherwise, you will continue to incur subscription charges.
