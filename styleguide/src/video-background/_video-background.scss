// for bc player case, styles need to be applied to the <video> child element
// that is generated by js.. this just touches the container at the moment
// moving away from our global player styles (ie by shedding video-playr__embed and the like)
// would seem to be a GOOD thing, for both cases. let's get that object-fit sauce to work for bc player version

// this results in a smaller video footprint off-centered on mobile,
// i would just delete outright, but have a feeling these are applicable to the
// stream-showtime/order use-case, so leaving commented out in hopes they'll be useful there
